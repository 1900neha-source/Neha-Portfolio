# AI Product Manager Portfolio

This repository contains my AI Product Manager (AI PM - Name) portfolio — a curated collection of projects, case studies, artifacts, and experiments that demonstrate my skills in product strategy, AI-driven solutions, stakeholder alignment, and delivery.

## About

I am building a portfolio focused on AI product management: ideation, data-informed roadmaps, ML product scoping, evaluation metrics, and go-to-market materials. This repo surfaces concrete examples of my work, including prototypes, prompt engineering notes, user research summaries, and launch artifacts.

## Contents

- `Images-Videos/` — visual assets and demos
- `LLM Playground/` — notebooks and HTML demos of experiments
- `prompts/` — curated prompts, templates, and playbooks

## Featured Sections

- Project case studies with context, problem, approach, impact, and lessons learned.
- Design artifacts: user journeys, PRDs, success metrics, and A/B test plans.
- Technical experiments: lightweight demos, prompt engineering, and data notes.

## How to use

Browse the folders to explore projects and assets. Each project folder includes a short README explaining the problem, the role I played, key decisions, and measurable outcomes.
